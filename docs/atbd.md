## Abstract

## Plain Language Summary

The terrestrial surface of the Earth is comprised of many substances. Using imaging spectroscopy, we work to classify these substances into groups in order to help with the interpretation of various algorithms. In this Version 1 of the EMIT Fractional Cover Product, we are focused on being able to determine the fractions comprised of bare rock/soil (areas where mineral determination algorithms are appropriate for interpretation), photosynthetic vegetation (largely 
identified by their characteristic red edge, chlorophyll absorptions, and low reflectance in the SWIR, appropriate for interpretation of trait estimation algorithms), and non-photosynthetic vegetation (which can include dead vegetation, leaf litter, wood, some lichens and biocrusts). All other surface types, as well as areas that are obscured by clouds, we seek to flag using the QC bands associated with this product.

We are providing this Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document in a github markdown format in order to provide a record of ongoing updates as algorithms improved via the commit record, as well as allowing the community to engage more directly in the process of documentation in keeping with NASA's commitment to open science.

## 1 Version Description

This is Version 1.0 of the EMIT fractional cover and fractional cover quality control (QC) product.

## 2 Introduction
Mineral dust aerosols originate as soil particles lifted into the atmosphere by wind erosion. Mineral dust created by
human activity makes a large contribution to the uncertainty of direct radiative forcing (RF) by anthropogenic aerosols 
(USGCRP and IPCC) and is a prominent aerosol constituent around the globe. However, we have poor understanding 
of its direct radiative effect, partly due to uncertainties in the dust mineral composition. Dust radiative forcing is 
highly dependent on its mineral-specific absorption properties. The current range of iron oxide abundance in dust source 
models translates into a large range of values, even changing the sign of the forcing (-0.15 to 0.21 W/m2) predicted by 
Earth System Models (ESMs) (Li et al., 2020). The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) selected the 
Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation (EMIT) to close this knowledge gap. NASA launched an instrument to the 
International Space Station (ISS) to directly measure and map the soil mineral composition of critical dust-forming 
regions worldwide.

## 3 Context/Background
As part of the EMIT mission, a three-class fractional cover product is being developed to provide estimates of the 
fractional cover of photosynthetic vegetation (PV or GV), non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV), and bare soil (S) within 
each 60 m EMIT pixel. This product will be used to help interpret the surface mineralogy results from the EMIT mission, 
as well as provide a valuable dataset for the broader science community.

Example spectra from the three classes are shown in Figure 3 from Ochoa et al., 2025.

### 3.1 Historical Perspective
Fractional cover products have been used for a variety of applications, including land cover classification, 
vegetation monitoring, and soil moisture estimation. The EMIT fractional cover product builds on this previous work by 
using the unique capabilities of the EMIT instrument to provide high-resolution estimates of fractional cover across the 
globe as the purview of the mission expands in its extended mission activities. The EMIT fractional cover product was 
developed as part of the prime mission activities but was not formally delivered to the DAAC. The product is being 
refined and formally delivered to the DAAC as part of the EMIT extended mission activities.
### 3.2 Additional Information
The fractional cover product described here is a three component model which is masked by a series of quality control (QC) flags. 
The three components are photosynthetic vegetation (PV), non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV), and bare soil (S). The QC flags include cloud, urban, water, and snow/ice. The fractional cover product is derived using a Monte Carlo Spectral Unmixing approach, which is described in detail in Section 4. The QC flags are derived using a combination of the EMIT L2A surface reflectance product (Green, 2022b), the ESA WorldCover land cover product (Zanaga et al., 2021), and the GSHHG global database of coastlines and rivers (Wessel and Smith, 1996). The QC flags are described in detail in Section 4.5.
## 4 Algorithm Description

### 4.1 Scientific Theory
The fractional cover product is derived using a Monte Carlo Spectral Unmixing approach. This approach uses a spectral library of endmembers to estimate the fractional cover of each component within each pixel. The spectral library used for the EMIT fractional cover product is derived from field and laboratory measurements of soils and vegetation. The spectral library includes endmembers for photosynthetic vegetation, non-photosynthetic vegetation, and bare soil. 
Here, we used the global endmember set (Ochoa et al. 2024; DOI: [10.21232/QijXnpFt](https://ecosis.org/package/drylands-spectral-libraries-in-support-of-emit)) curated for EMIT to forge our spectral unmixing library. From the global endmember set, we used a random selection of NPV and GV, whereas for soil, we used a 4-dimensional Convex Hull endmember reduction approach (procedures outlined in Ochoa et al. 2025; 
Code to build spectral unmixing library: [Terraspec](https://github.com/fotxoa-geo/terraspec/tree/production)).

![](../figs/em_reduction_visualization.png "Soil endmember reduction techniques.")

*Figure 4-1. A 2-dimensional Latin Hypercube and Convex hull endmember reduction approach being implemented on soil endmembers. Figure from Ochoa et al., 2025.* 

### 4.2 Mathematical Theory
To estimate fractional cover, we use a Monte Carlo Spectral Unmixing strategy, based on decades of literature (e.g., Roberts et al. 1998, Asner and Lobell 2000, and Dennison et al., 2019). 
Several key parameters, including the endmember selection strategy, observation normalization techniques, and the number of bootstrap samples were investigated. 
Simulation experiments comparing over one million synthetic spectra constructed with endmember holdout sets were utilized to select parameter values (generally following the approach of Okin et al., 2001, 2015).
Selected parameter values are shown in Table 4.2-1. Parameters were chosen based on a combination of mean absolute error, prediction variance, prediction bias, and computation time. 
All values can be tested through parameter selection in the unmix.jl script provided in the SpectralUnmixing EMIT SDS repository (https://github.com/emit-sds/SpectralUnmixing). A sample comparison between two scenarios is shown in Figure 4.2-1.

**Table 4.2-1.** _Unmixing parameter value selection_

| Parameter Name | Tested Values | Selected Values |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Endmember Selection | MESMA, SMA | SMA |
| Endmember Selection Strategy | Class-even, Random | Class-even |
| Normalization | None, Brightness, 1070, 1500, 1756, 2030 | Brightness |
| Maximum Number of Combinations (MESMA only) | 10, 100, 500, 1000 | NA |
| Number of Endmembers per Class per Bootstrap Draw (SMA only) | 5, 10, 30, 50 | 30 |
| Number of Bootstrap Draws | 1, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200 | 20 |

### 4.3 Fractional Cover Algorithm Input Variables

The required input files for fractional cover production are in Table 4.3-1.

**Table 4.3-1.** _Input variables_

| Name | Description | Unit | Required |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| EMIT L2A Surface Reflectance | hemispherical-directional reflectance factor per wavelength | unitless | true |
| EMIT L2A Surface Reflectance Uncertainty | hemispherical-directional reflectance uncertainty per wavelength | unitless | true |
| Endmember Spectral Library | collection of spectral surface endmembers (HDRF per wavelength) | unitless | true |

### 4.4 Fractional Cover Algorithm Output Variables
The EMIT output data products delivered to the DAAC use their formatting conventions; the system operates internally on data products stored as binary data cubes with detached human-readable ASCII header files. For the fraction cover product, the output variables are: 
1. Fractional cover, provided as an n x c x 3 BIL interleave data cube, with c columns and n lines. Each channel contains the fractional cover as calculated by E(MC)<sup>2</sup> (see section 4.2). The band order is NPV fractional cover (band 1), PV fractional cover (band 2), and soil fractional cover (band 3).
2. Fractional cover uncertainty, provided as an n x c x 3 BIL interleave data cube, with c columns and n lines. Each channel contains the estimated uncertainty of the fraction cover, as defined in section 6.2. The band order is NPV fractional cover uncertainty (Band 1), PV fractional cover uncertainty (band 2), and soil fractional cover uncertainty (band 3).

These products are consistent with the auxiliary data products described in the EMIT L3ASA ATBD (Brodrick et al., 2023).

### 4.5 Fractional Cover QC Product Input Variables
The required input files for fractional cover QC production are in Table 4.5-1.

**Table 4.5-1.** _QA input variables_

| Name | Description | Spatial Resolution | Required | Type |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| EMIT L2A Surface Reflectance | hemispherical-directional reflectance factor (HDRF) per wavelength | 60 m | true | raster
| EMIT L2A Mask | estimated surface reflectance uncertainty and masks | 60 m | true | raster
| ESA WorldCover | global landcover classification derived from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data | 10 m | true | raster
| GSHHG | the Global Self-consistent, Hierarchical, High-resolution Geography Database for coastlines and rivers | <60 m | true | vector

#### 4.5.1 Clouds

Flag all pixels identified as "cirrus" or "cloud" by the EMIT L2A Mask product (Green, 2022a) as **cloud**.

#### 4.5.2 Urban

Flag all pixels with an ESA WorldCover raster value of 50 as **urban**, which corresponds to the "built-up" class. ESA WorldCover documentation defines the built-up class as: "Land covered by buildings, roads and other man-made structures such as railroads. Buildings include both residential and industrial building. Urban green (parks, sports facilities) is not included in this class. Waste dump deposits and extraction sites are considered as bare" (Zanaga et al., 2021). The 10 m WorldCover built-up class dataset was aggregated to the 60 m EMIT resolution using gdalwarp with bilinear resampling. 


#### 4.5.3 Water

Flag all pixels identified as "water" by the EMIT L2A Mask product (Green, 2022a) and all pixels that intersect with the GSHHG global database of coastlines and rivers (Wessel and Smith, 1996) as **water**. Nearest-neighbor resampling is used to find intersecting EMIT pixels with the GSHHG vector dataset. 

#### 4.5.4 Snow/Ice

The Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) is an index-based metric used to identify pixels that are most likely to be snow and/or ice (Hall et al., 1995). The following equation is used to calculate NDSI from the EMIT L2A surface reflectance product (Green, 2022b): 

$$
NDSI = \frac{Green - SWIR}{Green + SWIR}
$$

Where 560 nm is the "Green" wavelength band and 1600 nm is the "SWIR (shortwave-infrared)" wavelength band. Following recommendations in the literature that suggest a global NDSI threshold of 0.4 (Hall et al., 2015), flag all pixels with an NDSI value greater than 0.4 as **snow/ice**.

### 4.6 Fractional Cover QC Product Output Variables
The EMIT output data products delivered to the DAAC use their formatting conventions, the system operates internally on data products stored as binary data cubes with detached human-readable ASCII header files.

The QC product is a single band cloud-optimized GeoTIFF (COG), where each flagged QC pixel is assigned one of the following values with colors associated with figures below in parentheses for reference:  
 * 1 = Cloud (orange)
 * 2 = Urban (green)
 * 3 = Water (red)
 * 4 = Snow/Ice

 For pixels that contain multiple QC flags (e.g., a water pixel covered by clouds), the following hierarchy is employed, with lower values taking precedence over higher values: 
 1. If the pixel contains clouds, QC = 1 
 2. If the pixel contains built-up material, QC = 2 
 3. If the pixel contains water or is a coastal pixel, QC = 3
 4. If the pixel is classified as snow/ice, QC = 4

This hierarchy order minimizes incorrect classification of pixels with NDSI thresholding, which regularly over-identifies liquid water as snow/ice across the EMIT archive. 

## 5 Algorithm Usage Constraints

Note that the QC flags are not mutually exclusive and also the QC flags are not intended as a comprehensive cloud, urban, water, or snow/ice identification product. Rather, it is intended to flag pixels that are likely to be misclassified by the fractional cover algorithm and it is not recommended to use the QC product as a standalone cloud, urban, water, or snow/ice product.

## 6 Performance Assessment

### 6.1 Validation Methods

We base our field validation on Spectral Line Point Intercept Transects (SLPIT) developed by Meyer & Okin 2015. SLPIT 
involves taking spectra along continuous intervals in the field, unmixing them, and comparing them to spaceborne/airborne
imagery. Overall, SLPIT estimates of fractional cover align well with EMIT observations. For a more detailed description of the field protocol, sites, and results see: 
<i>Ochoa et al. in prep</i>.

### 6.2 Uncertainties

To estimate the uncertainty of the Monte Carlo SMA results, we utilize the variation in the bootstrapped retrievals. During each simulation, the endmember selection is seeded differently (representing model error) and the reflectance is perturbed by a (per-wavelength) random deviation proportionate to the channelized reflectance uncertainty provided by L2A. The standard deviation of the soil fractional cover from the different simulations (𝜎 <_>𝑠 𝑗) is then used as the uncertainty, as in Ochoa et al. (2025).

We neglect the uncertainty associated with QC assessment for the purposes of providing a mask for this product.

### 6.3 Known Issues
The spectral library used for unmixing may not be representative of all surface types globally, leading to potential inaccuracies in fractional cover estimates in some regions. Here we describe known issues with both the fractional cover and fractional cover QC products for users to be aware of. Many of these issues are being addressed in ongoing work to improve the products and will be resolved in a planned v2 release.

#### 6.3.1 Fractional Cover 
The following issues have been identified with the fractional cover product in areas that are not flagged by the current QC product. This section will be updated as issues with the QC product are addressed or the fractional cover product is improved.
* At cloud edges and in cloud shadows regions are often inaccurately estimated as high NPV (Figures 1 & 2). Users may opt to use the cloud buffer mask provided in the EMIT L2A Mask product (Green, 2022a) to remove these pixels from analysis.

![Example of NPV misclassification](..figs/NPV_KnownIssue2.png "Example of NPV misclassification")

*Figure 2: Example of NPV misclassification along cloud edges on the north side of clouds present in the image.*


#### 6.3.2 Fractional Cover QC
* The GSHHG dataset does not include major inland lakes, including the Great Lakes, which should be classified as QC water pixels
* EMIT L2A mask product may fail to identify liquid water for acquisitions with substantial sun glint, leading to misclassified water pixels in the QC product
* NDSI threshold value of 0.4 may over-identify liquid water pixels as snow/ice pixels in the QC product
* Shaded snow/ice pixels may be identified as water in the QC product.
* Bright snow/ice pixels may be misidentified as clouds in the QC product.
* Some clouds over water may result in no QC flag being assigned to the pixel.
